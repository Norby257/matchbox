### Aggregated Subscription Box Platform

**The Problem:** With all the subscription box options available (BirchBox, BarkBox, etc.) itâ€™s hard to pick just one, and the cost of subscribing to multiple boxes can add up quickly.

**The Solution:** Use our platform. You would pay a monthly membership fee to us, and in exchange we provide a curated selection of third-party subscription boxes that you can choose from, spanning multiple areas of interest (i.e., makeup, fashion, pets, kid-friendly). 

**The best part?** You can choose a new subscription box brand each month! Or continue with one you like for any length of time. 
_For example, if you love makeup boxes you can opt into different brands of makeup boxes every month, stick with one of your favorites, or switch it up entirely._
